add additional render engine to foundry nuke

Open Source Render Engine Integration for Nuke
Project Overview

This project aims to develop an open-source rendering engine plugin for Foundry's Nuke, similar to V-Ray for Nuke. The goal is to integrate popular rendering engines like Cycles and Eevee (from Blender) so that users can seamlessly switch between them inside Nuke for high-quality rendering and fast previews.
Why This Project?

Currently, Nuke lacks free, physically-based renderers integrated into its pipeline. By leveraging powerful open-source engines like Cycles and Eevee, this plugin will democratize high-quality rendering in compositing workflows.
What We Need

    C++ developers familiar with Nuke’s SDK and rendering pipelines

    Python developers to build UI panels and tools inside Nuke

    Artists and technical directors to test and provide feedback

    Documentation writers to help improve onboarding

Features to Implement

    Seamless switching between Cycles and Eevee renderers

    Support for Nuke’s native camera, lights, and materials

    Interactive viewport previews

    Export and render final frames or sequences

    Configurable render settings and optimization
